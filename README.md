Back in the fall I wanted to give iOS development a try and was in the middle of a "yacht rock" listening kick - if you don't know what that is, educate yourself:

http://www.yachtrock.com/
http://www.yachtornyacht.com/

In the midst of this phase, I got the idea to develop an app that tells you if a song is "yacht rock" or not, identifying the song (like Shazam) and checking it against the database of "certified yacht" songs.  So, I made this my first real app. It has the following capabilities:
* Record and identify a song's "yachtski" status (if not in the database, returns "Unknown" - but given how narrow the genre is, it's probably "nyacht")
* Check history of songs identified
* Manually search the database of songs in the "certified yacht" database and their information

It's not rocket science, but it is kinda fun and tongue in cheek, a good first app. Served as a great primer for app development, utilizing various view controllers, Core Data, multiple APIs, and external libraries via Cocoapods. I decided not to release it on the App Store due to free API limits and the costs of an Apple Developer Account vs. how popular this app would be (it wouldn't), but it is essentially a complete app and works well.
